                <h3>Personally</h3>
                <p>
                    I grown up as a sport guy as I used to practice many sports such as football, backetball, handball and swimming.<br><br>
                    Recently I started to like hiking specially when I reached to Belgium as during the covid-19 lockdown and less opportunity to travel around, I decided to visit as much city and open green areas in Belgium as I can, and hiking became a big part of my life and I discovered that I like mountains and nature challenges.
                    <br><br> I myself is a social person as I like to be around people and get introduced to new cultures and people habbits, I discovered with this my 
                    love to travel so I can meet and see what is going around and live the different experiences
